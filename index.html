  <h1>Colleges offline??? What's Next!!</h1>
  <h3>Hey All ðŸ¤—</h3>
  <p class="main content">
    As we are seeing in the news and also some colleges have started sending notice that college may start offline in this semester. Schools are already declared offline. We all know that what all struggles we would face as soon as colleges start offline. No doubt online has few cons but they are few. And we managed to overcome all the issues faced in online classes and now offline will be really problematic. 70% of syllabus is already covered and all that was done in online and now how can colleges conduct offline exams?
    Apart from that we know that we students were able to learn so many things online. We guys have been completing udemy, coursera courses, took part in many competitions, learned core subjects, dsa, cp, OS and what not. All this was impossible if college was offline. (Personally I would say if offline college is started my whole career will end)	  
    Anyway we already know pros and cons so no drama bazzi, but I am making this web page so that <b> if tomorrow colleges and MU declare that in a week we are reopening colleges then at that time we can't storm the twitter. There wont be any unity among us. That's why I decided to make a publically available web page and telegram group where people can unite and give a last fight (no issue even if we lose) to stop our career getting wasted </b>

<h3> If link not working message me on telegram +16265228202</h3>
		
  <p> Though currently its just probablity but what if it happens for real. Also neither teachers, nor students or staff, noone wants offline. Everyone are happy then why all this? At end moment we shouldn't feel that we could do nothing and thats the reason I am bringing people together</p>
